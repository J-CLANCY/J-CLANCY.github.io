Here you will find evidence which indicates that I apparently am under the delusion that I have something interesting to say to the world. More seriously, these posts are actually for future me. I have found it extremely useful to leave breadcrumbs from past-Joe to future-Joe to allow me to quickly recall or ramp-up on context I was previously embedded in.
